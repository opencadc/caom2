- run 'gradle clean build'
- cd build/distributions
- untar the caom2-collection-validator tarball
- cd into the caom2-collection-validator-<version>/bin directory

See the usage statement for more information

Requirments:
- valid cert file
- collection name
- source (either a web service or database name & credentials)


DETAILS
-------
Progress tracking & error handling:

Progress is tracked using a text file: name is required on the command line. 
If the application stops during validation (either by manual quit, or for a
severe error,) the next run of the application for the same collection will start
at the observation listed in the progress file. 

In this case, to start at the beginning of a collection either remove the existing progress file
or use one with a different name (provide a new name on the command line.)

The progress file is deleted if the validation runs successfully.
